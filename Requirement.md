# Product Specification: Akshara Typography

## 1. Product Vision
To become the definitive platform for curated Hindi-English (Devanagari-Latin) typography, solving the "mismatched script" problem in Indian digital products. Akshara empowers designers and developers with harmonized font pairings, clear licensing, and instant technical integration.

## 2. Core Problems Solved
*   **Visual Inconsistency:** Hindi and English fonts often have different x-heights or stroke contrasts, making bilingual websites look cluttered.
*   **Licensing Ambiguity:** Uncertainty around which Hindi fonts can be used commercially or in mobile apps.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Hindi fonts can be heavy; developers need subsetting guidance and efficient delivery methods.

## 3. Key Features
*   **Bilingual Preview Engine:** A live sandbox to test fonts with mixed Hindi-English strings across multiple contexts (Blog, UI, Mobile).
*   **AI-Powered Pairings:** Curated suggestions for headlines and body text with design rationale generated by Gemini AI.
*   **Developer Sandbox:** Ready-to-use CSS snippets, `@font-face` declarations, and performance optimization checklists.
*   **Licensing Tiers:** Transparent pricing for Open Font License (OFL), Commercial, and Subscription-based typefaces.

## 4. Target Audience
*   **UI/UX Designers** building localized Indian interfaces.
*   **Frontend Engineers** implementing multi-script support.
*   **Brand Agencies** looking for cohesive bilingual identity systems.
